        <footer>Now, this© is a story all about how
            My life got flipped-turned upside down
            And I'd like to take a minute
            Just sit right there
            I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
            In West Philadelphia© born and raised
            On the playground was where I spent most of my days
            Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
            And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
            When a couple© of guys who were up to no good
            Started making trouble in my neighborhood
            I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
            She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"</footer>
